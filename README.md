To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

## Localhost HTTPS

If the server runs without HTTPS, the browser will block the iframe from loading ([see 3) here](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/913512/pages/launch-url))

Therefore, we also listen on HTTPS connections on [`localhost:4001`](https://localhost:4001).
